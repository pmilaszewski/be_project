Shop Product Reviews allows you to collect your customers' opinions&nbsp;<b>about your products<\/b>&nbsp;but also&nbsp;<b>about their general shopping experience on your shop.<\/b>&nbsp;Do you want to know their opinion on specific points? Define&nbsp;<b>your own rating criteria,<\/b>&nbsp;either for your products or your shop. You want to import your old reviews to keep your history? No problem, the module offers a simple and intuitive import\/export tool!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Our module&nbsp;<b>respects the GDPR<\/b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>all the European directives in force<\/b>&nbsp;(such as the decree n\u00b0 2017-1436, or the directive (EU) 2019\/2161) concerning the information obligations related to online consumer reviews, by putting in place everything necessary for the customer to be informed in a clear and precise way about the review management system. It allows you to display a \"Verified Purchase\" badge to certify that the review is a result of an order, and only customers who have an account can review your products and your shop.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>INCREASE YOUR CONVERSION RATE AND YOUR REVENUE<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>88% of Internet users<\/b>&nbsp;consult customer reviews before making a purchase on an e-commerce site and&nbsp;<b>91% of 18-25 year olds<\/b>&nbsp;give as much importance to reviews on the Internet as to those of their relatives. By displaying customer reviews of your products and\/or your store on your website, you&nbsp;<b>increase your customers' trust<\/b>&nbsp;in your brand. Customer reviews are a social proof of your store's reliability and play the role of a digital word of mouth. The importance of customer reviews in the e-commerce world is well known: they are now&nbsp;<b>a key element in the decision-making process and in your marketing strategy.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Moreover, customer reviews are a great free advertising tool and a way to get relevant, recent and regularly renewed content. This UGC (User Generated Content) is one of the main criteria examined by Google to improve your SEO. If your theme is properly tagged, Google will be able to show the stars corresponding to the average rating of the products in its natural results which will also improve&nbsp;<b>your visibility, your click rate and your traffic.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Our&nbsp;<b>\"Shop Product Reviews\"<\/b>&nbsp;module is much more than a simple review collection module. With its multiple features and options for displaying reviews, whether on product pages or list pages, through dedicated blocks or badges, our&nbsp;<b>\"Shop Product Reviews\"<\/b>&nbsp;module allows you&nbsp;<b>to reassure your customers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase your conversion rate.<\/b>&nbsp;According to a study, from the first review posted on a product, the conversion rate increases by 10%, then 30% after 50 reviews, and up to more than 44% with 200 reviews! So don't hesitate!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>COLLECT REVIEWS ON YOUR PRODUCTS, YOUR SHOP OR BOTH!<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>The \"\"Shop Product Reviews\"\" module<\/b>&nbsp;allows you to activate&nbsp;<b>independently<\/b>&nbsp;the collection of product reviews and the collection of reviews on your store in general. For each review system, many options are available: activation of moderation, display of reviews only in the current language, activation of a voting system, display of a \"latest reviews\" block, etc...<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The product ratings will be displayed as stars. You have the ability to customize the color of the stars to fit your theme as there are an infinite number of colors available.&nbsp;<b>A \"Verified Purchase\" badge<\/b>&nbsp;can be displayed next to the reviews that result from an order, to&nbsp;<b>further reinforce the confidence of future buyers.<\/b>&nbsp;The color of the badge is also fully customizable as well as its text.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Whether it is for product or shop reviews,&nbsp;<b>a system of precise scheduling of the sending of rating request e-mails is available.<\/b>&nbsp;You also have the possibility to send a reminder if your customer has not given a review following the first e-mail. The titles and texts of the e-mails&nbsp;<b>can be configured<\/b>&nbsp;directly through the module, for each language of your store.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>Product reviews<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Give the possibility to evaluate a product to all registered customers or only to customers who ordered the product. The latter option makes it possible to further increase the reliability of customer feedback on your products.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Enjoy flexible positioning on product pages: Display your reviews either in the footer or within a tab (if your theme supports page tabs), and decide where to position the average product rating. Also decide to display the average product rating on list pages.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Allow your visitors to filter the reviews by rating and sort them as they want. Show them the distribution of the number of reviews by rating and allow them to get a quick and global idea of the reviews on a product, by enabling the display of a \"battle\" block showing the best review and the most critical one opposite each other.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Also note that by implementing product reviews, the average rating can appear in Google's natural results as stars,&nbsp;<b>which will attract attention and increase your visibility.<\/b>&nbsp;Links that display a product rating have&nbsp;<b>a click-through rate (CTR) between 15 and 30% higher.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>Shop reviews<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Why not also collect feedback from your customers about their overall shopping experience?&nbsp;<b>Activate shop reviews<\/b>&nbsp;and allow your customers to share their feelings about their experience on your site, the choice offered, the offers or even the ease of payment and delivery! This will strengthen the bond you have with them by showing them that you are listening to their needs and will contribute to&nbsp;<b>increase loyalty<\/b>.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Place the link to the shop review form wherever you want on your website: customer account, product pages, menu, ...

Create your own rating criteria!&nbsp;<b>Whether it is for products or the store,<\/b>&nbsp;the module offers you the possibility to create personalized criteria. You decide how the criteria are worded and whether you want to reserve them for certain products or categories!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Use the product rating criteria to ask your customers to rate specific characteristics of certain items in order to validate or not your choice of products or suppliers: fabric quality, price, fit of a garment, sturdiness etc... It is&nbsp;<b>a free<\/b>&nbsp;way to know the efficiency of your catalog and&nbsp;<b>a precious help<\/b>&nbsp;to make informed decisions about your products.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>As for the rating criteria for your shop in general, you also have the choice: navigation, site ergonomics, variety of products, clarity of descriptions, ease of payment, or even choice of delivery points! The feedback from your customers will allow you&nbsp;<b>to make the right choices and get a better customer satisfaction rate.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>Not to mention the SEO benefit of the criteria!<\/b>&nbsp;If you guide customers by asking them to give feedback on specific topics through the rating criteria, your customers will tend to use specific keywords that will boost your SEO on certain queries.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO POST A REVIEW BY OFFERING THEM A VOUCHER<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Your customers sometimes need a little help! Encourage them to leave their opinion on the products they bought, or about your shop, by offering them a voucher in exchange! This will encourage them&nbsp;<b>to come back to place an order on your online store and will increase their loyalty.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Once your offer is configured within the module, it will be displayed in the rating invitation e-mails and also in the product or shop rating forms.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>RIGHT TO REPLY TO BAD REVIEWS<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>t's never easy to receive negative reviews. However, it can be an excellent opportunity to show that you are listening to your customers. That's why we allow you to respond to a dissatisfied customer in order to try to understand their dissatisfaction and provide a solution. This will allow you to show them that you offer a quality service and that customer satisfaction is your priority.
